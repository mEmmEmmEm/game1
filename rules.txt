Arrow keys are used to control the Timon. The up arrow implements the character's jump. 
The down arrow indicates access to places with a half–block size, horizontal position.
 You can return the character to its original position by pressing the "Down Arrow". 
Left and right arrows – move around the map. To break the sponge block, the character 
must adopt horizontal mode and interact with the block using the Left/Right Arrow.
 Arrow keys are also used to control the Pumbaa. The up arrow implements the character's 
jump by one block. Holding the arrow down is a kick that can be used to move the stone 
blocks and "kill" the hyena enemy. Left and right arrows – move around the map. 

To switch between characters, use the "R" key.

The number of lives of each of the characters and the bug points scored can be seen at 
the top of the playing field. Each character has three health points. You can lose them 
when you encounter "enemies". The "porcupine" can only be jumped over, the "hyena" can 
only be killed using the "Pumbaa" ability. If at least one character loses all three life 
points, the level is considered to be passed. 

To complete the level, you need to reach the finish line and score the maximum number of 
points (20/20 "bugs"). If all the conditions are met, the next level is started, 
if level 1 has been completed, or the start menu opens.
